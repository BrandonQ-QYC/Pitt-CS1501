# CS 1501 Assignment 1 Write-up

In my `Crossword.java`, I mainly use solve() method and isvaild method to find the possible solution. And I also have printBoard and letterPoints to show the output and score.

- `Crossword()`: In the Crossword, I write to ask the user load 2 files including the dictionary file and board game file. 
Then I create two matrix Board and currentBoard.

- `solve()` : In the solve, I write the first double loop for checking the Board if full or not. And use the isFull character to record.
Then, for every '+' position, a loop can try the letter from A~Z with the Check isValid or Not. Next for loop is recursion.

- `isValid()`: At beginning, I build up two stringbuilder which are used to check the available prefix and word. 
Then I use a for loop to set up the currentboard which help to check the word in that row or col. In order to check the block in the board, I write two if and else if in two part. And the for four different situation, in the string start, end, middle or not have block.
  Then check the letter whether at the edge or beside the block to find prefix can work or cannot work. 

- `printBoard()`: Print the final board. 

- `letterPoints()`: Load the `letterpoints.txt` and calculate the score. 

n - the number of potential letter('+') in the board

Method | Run-times (in worst case)
------ | -------------------------
Crossword | n
solve+isValid | n^26
letterPoints | 26*n
